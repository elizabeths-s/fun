Humorous stories about my very unique mother.

## A Gift

My mother and I live in the same apartment building; she lives two doors away from me.

One day during the 2020 pandemic, she called me and asked to "borrow" some half and half for her coffee because she had run out of milk (her standard coffee additive). I filled a small soup thermos with half and half, and then left the container in her mailbox, which is just outside of her front door.

A day or two later, she texted me to let me know she had returned my thermos in my mailbox, which is also just outside of my front door. In the text, she mentioned leaving a "gift" inside of the container. So, I opened my door, grabbed the thermos, and then opened it. 

My "gift" was a random fistful of cilantro.
